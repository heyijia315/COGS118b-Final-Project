# COGS118b-Final-Project

Our research problem is to compare how well unsupervised and supervised models perform on a binary classification to detect cardiovascular disease. We used k-means, a mixture of Gaussians models from the class and DBSCAN as unsupervised learning and 
Logistic regression, Support vector machine, decision tree as supervised learning models. We improved our unsupervised models, MOG and K-means clustering with the accuracy 0.6 and 0.7 respectively. The k-means runs pretty good for this dataset after adjusting!
